# DotNetConf 2019 Israel Edition
The source code in this repository was built as a demo for my session at the Israeli edition of DotNetConf 2019.
It showcases how to build modern cloud native services with ASP&#46;NET Core 3.0, with a focus on:
1. gRPC
2. Endpoint Routing
3. Worker Services
4. Health Checks
4. Deployment to K8s
